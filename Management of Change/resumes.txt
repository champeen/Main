Shravya Bandela - 5+ years (maybe not enough exp?) - but used Python, designed website using Java/ASP.net. .Net and C# listed (lives in Orlando,FL)
Jeff Drummonds - 20+ years exp (good).  Has both SQL AND development experience (potentially like Vince and I), and equally importantly is not jumping to a new job every 1.5 years.  HOWEVER, the resume is strange.  It is written from 3rd party perspective, has mispelled words/horrible grammar, and has the look and feel of 1980. 
Siddharth Gaddam - Best Resume IMO.  However, jumps jobs every 1.5 years.  Heavy .Net developer. AWS. SQL.  All around solid resume.
Anthony Kolka - Local in saginaw?  All work is in Colorado. Looks like heavier on the infrastructure side, but seems to have some app development also.  Experienced. Stays at a place for a while. If local, this might me the one?
Kevin Puszcz - lives close (Macomb, MI) and will relocate. Is not working and has not worked in almost a year and a half? (red flag). SKills he lists are impressive and right up our alley (.net, sql, python, c#, aws etc...). Is it thruthful though?
Sameer Yaqoob - maybe 2nd best resume?  8 years experience, solid all-around resume.  Stays at a job for about 5 years, and very much like Vince and I in regards to skills. From NJ though.
